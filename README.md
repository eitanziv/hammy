# Hammy

> Codebase Intelligence Engine — deep structural and historical context for AI coding agents

<p align="center">

</p>

Hammy gives AI coding agents a high-fidelity map of your codebase. It parses source code into a queryable call graph, tracks version control history, and exposes everything through an MCP server — so agents spend less time guessing and more time doing.

**Best on:** legacy monoliths, team codebases, anything where "just grep it" stops working.

---

## Why Hammy?

Most coding agents navigate by reading files and hoping for the best. Hammy gives them:

- **A call graph** — not just "this function exists" but "these 12 things call it, and here's what it calls"
- **Risk signals** — which code is high-churn AND heavily depended on (the landmines)
- **Blast radius** — before changing anything, know exactly what breaks
- **Orientation** — understand a 200-file module in one call instead of reading every file

---

## Features

- **Multi-language AST parsing** — PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, C# (Tree-sitter based)
- **Full call expression indexing** — stores `$this->resolve(PaymentService::class)` not just `resolve`, enabling argument-level filtering
- **Cross-language bridge detection** — links `fetch('/api/users')` in JS to the backend handler
- **Semantic + hybrid search** — dense vector search (Qdrant) + BM25, merged via Reciprocal Rank Fusion
- **Structural search** — filter by visibility, async, param count, return type, complexity score
- **Impact analysis** — N-hop call graph traversal: know the full blast radius before touching anything
- **PR diff analysis** — parse a unified diff (or auto-diff uncommitted changes), get HIGH/MED/LOW risk per changed symbol
- **Hotspot scoring** — `log(callers) × log(churn)`: surfaces code that's both heavily depended on AND frequently modified
- **LLM enrichment** — auto-generate plain-English summaries for every indexed function and class
- **Brain / memory layer** — agents store and recall research findings across sessions (invaluable on large codebases)
- **Watch mode** — incremental re-indexing on file change
- **VCS integration** — Git log, blame, churn; Mercurial scaffolded
- **MCP server** — all tools available to any MCP client (Cursor, Claude Desktop, VS Code, etc.)
- **Smart ignore** — four-layer filtering: defaults → .gitignore → .hgignore → .hammyignore

---

## Installation

Requires [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) and Docker (for Qdrant).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dvnc0/hammy.git
cd hammy
uv sync --extra dev

# Start Qdrant
docker compose up -d

# Install as a CLI tool (very recommended)
uv tool install --editable .
```

**Optional extras:**

| Extra | What it adds | Install |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `redis` | `hammy export redis` command | `uv tool install --editable '.[redis]'` |

---

## Quick Start

After you install the CLI tool, you can run these commands:

```bash
# Point Hammy at your project
hammy init /path/to/your/project
```

This will create a `config/` folder and 3 config files: `hammy.yaml`, `agents.yaml`, `tasks.yaml`, a `.hammyignore` file, and a `HAMMY.md` agent guide (see [Wiring up your AI agent](#wiring-up-your-ai-agent)). You must configure the `agents.yaml` file to use hammy and to index your codebase.

```bash
# Index the codebase
cd /path/to/your/project
hammy index

# Start the MCP server (connect from your IDE)
hammy serve

# Query with the AI agent directly
hammy query "Where is the payment processing logic and who calls it?"

# Watch for changes and re-index incrementally
hammy watch
```

---

## Wiring up your AI agent

Connecting the MCP server isn't enough on its own — coding agents default to grep and file reading out of habit, and only discover Hammy's tools if they're told when to reach for them. `hammy init` sets up two things to fix that:

**`HAMMY.md`** — a routing guide written into your project root: which tool to use for which question, the pre-change workflow (`impact_analysis` → `hotspot_score`), and when to fall back to grep. Hammy never touches your existing agent files; instead, add one line to your `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.cursorrules`, or `CONTEXT.md`:

> This project is indexed by the `hammy` MCP server. Read HAMMY.md before navigating, searching, or modifying code.

**A Claude Code skill** — `.claude/skills/hammy/SKILL.md`, installed automatically when your project has a `.claude/` directory (or with `hammy init --claude-skill`). Its trigger description fires on code-navigation phrasing ("where is this called?", "is this safe to change?") and points the agent at HAMMY.md and the right tools at exactly the moment it would otherwise reach for grep.

The two work together: the reference line makes agents load HAMMY.md at session start, and the skill re-surfaces it mid-session when a navigation question comes up. Both are plain files — edit them to match how your team works.

---

## MCP Tools

All tools are available via `hammy serve` to any MCP client. Grouped by what you're trying to do:

### Orientation — understand unfamiliar code fast

#### `explain_symbol` ⭐
**The single most useful tool.** One call returns a 360° view of a symbol: full definition (file, line, params, return type, visibility, async, LLM summary), direct callers, direct callees, sibling symbols in the same file, and recent commits. Best first move when investigating any symbol — then escalate to `find_usages` for the complete call-site list or `impact_analysis` for multi-hop blast radius.

```
explain_symbol("PaymentService")
→ definition, 8 callers, 3 callees, 12 siblings, last 5 commits
```

#### `module_summary`
**Orient yourself on a directory without opening a single file.** Groups all symbols under a path into a structured table of contents — classes with nested methods first, then functions — across every file in the directory. Use this before diving into an unfamiliar module.

```
module_summary("app/Services/Payment/")
→ 3 files, 47 symbols, organized by class hierarchy
```

#### `ast_query`
Parse any file and see its full symbol tree: every class, method, function, endpoint, and import with line numbers, visibility, and LLM summaries. Filter by type (`classes`, `functions`, `methods`, `endpoints`, `imports`).

#### `list_files`
List every indexed file with its language. Good first call on an unfamiliar project to understand scope before searching.

---

### Search — find what you're looking for

#### `search_symbols`
Keyword search over symbol names, ranked by match quality (exact → prefix → substring → summary). Use when you know roughly what you're looking for but not the exact name.

#### `lookup_symbol`
You know the exact name — get the full definition immediately: file, line range, params, return type, visibility, async flag, and LLM summary. Accepts up to 20 names per call, so after a search you can drill into every interesting result at once. Falls back to word-boundary match if no exact hit.

```
lookup_symbol(["UserController", "PaymentService", "getRenew"])
→ 3 full definitions in one call
```

#### `search_code_hybrid`
Combines BM25 (exact identifiers) with semantic embeddings (conceptual matches), merged via RRF. Use when your query mixes exact terms and concepts: `"sendPersonalInvite email logic"`. Without Qdrant it degrades gracefully to keyword-only (BM25) search.

#### `structural_search`
Find symbols by shape, not name. Useful for refactoring sprints and code reviews.

```
structural_search(node_type="method", visibility="public", min_params=4)
→ all public methods with 4+ parameters

structural_search(min_complexity=15, file_filter="Services/")
→ high-complexity methods in the services layer
```

Parameters: `node_type`, `language`, `visibility`, `async_only`, `min_params`, `max_params`, `return_type`, `name_pattern`, `file_filter`, `min_complexity`, `limit`

---

### Call Graph — trace dependencies

#### `find_usages`
Find every call site for a function or method. Pass the bare name (`charge`, not `PaymentService::charge`) — call expressions only contain the bare name. Word-boundary matched so `save` won't match `saveAll`. Now with `argument_filter` to narrow by what's passed in — critical for dependency-injection heavy codebases.

```
find_usages("resolve", argument_filter="PaymentService")
→ only calls to resolve() that pass PaymentService, not the other 40
```

Parameters: `symbol_name`, `file_filter`, `argument_filter`

#### `impact_analysis`
**"If I change this, what breaks?"** Traverses the call graph N hops deep. Use `direction="callers"` before any refactor to map the full dependency chain. Use `direction="callees"` to see what a function depends on. Use `direction="both"` for the full neighbourhood.

```
impact_analysis("charge", depth=3, direction="callers")
→ everything downstream that will break
```

#### `find_bridges`
Finds cross-language endpoint connections — e.g. links a `fetch('/api/v1/users')` in React to the backend route handler. Useful when tracing frontend→backend flows.

---

### Risk — know before you touch

#### `hotspot_score` ⭐
**Mandatory pre-work before any significant change.** Scores each symbol by `log(callers) × log(churn)`. High score = heavily depended on AND frequently modified = highest risk. Near zero = safe to change. Run this before touching any unfamiliar code.

```
hotspot_score(file_filter="app/Services/", top_n=10)
→ ranked list of landmines in the services layer
```

#### `pr_diff`
**"What's the risk of this PR?"** Parses a diff, identifies every changed symbol, and rates each one LOW/MED/HIGH based on caller count. Accepts raw diff text, a base ref, or `working_tree=True` to automatically diff your uncommitted changes.

```
pr_diff(working_tree=True)              # analyse uncommitted changes
pr_diff(base_ref="main")               # compare branch against main
pr_diff(diff_text="<paste from GitHub>") # analyse a PR diff
```

---

### VCS History — understand context and ownership

#### `git_log`
Recent commit history for a file or the whole repo. Shows what changed, when, and by whom.

#### `git_blame`
Line-by-line authorship. Use when you need to understand intent, know who to ask about a tricky section, or check whether a suspicious line is recent or ancient.

#### `file_churn`
Commit frequency per file over a time window. High churn = actively changing or repeatedly fixed. Run before diving into a module to know whether you're on stable ground or in a churn zone.

---

### Semantic Memory — retain research across sessions *(requires Qdrant)*

#### `store_context`
Save a research finding to persistent memory with a key, tags, and source files. Sub-agents and future sessions can retrieve it instantly instead of re-researching.

```
store_context(
  key="auth-flow-research",
  content="Authentication touches 40 files. Entry point is AuthController::login...",
  tags=["auth", "sprint-42"]
)
```

#### `recall_context`
Retrieve stored research by exact key or semantic query.

#### `list_context`
List all stored memory entries with their tags and timestamps.

---

### Housekeeping

#### `index_status`
Quick orientation: total symbols, files, edges, and languages indexed. Call first on an unfamiliar project, or to confirm the index is populated before searching.

#### `reindex`
Refresh the in-memory symbol index after editing files. Pass `update_qdrant=true` to also refresh semantic embeddings. Pass `enrich=true` to generate LLM summaries for new symbols.

---

## Common Workflows

**Before touching unfamiliar code:**
```
hotspot_score(file_filter="app/Services/Payment/")   # find the landmines
explain_symbol("PaymentService")                      # understand the entry point
impact_analysis("charge", depth=3)                    # map the blast radius
```

**Exploring an unfamiliar module:**
```
module_summary("app/Services/Payment/")              # table of contents
lookup_symbol(["PaymentService", "Webhook", "StripeClient"])  # drill into key symbols
```

**Before merging a PR:**
```
pr_diff(working_tree=True)                           # risk-rate your changes
pr_diff(base_ref="main")                             # or compare against main
```

**Tracking DI dependencies:**
```
find_usages("resolve", argument_filter="PaymentService")  # who injects PaymentService
find_usages("make", argument_filter="UserRepository")     # who creates UserRepository
```

**Planning a refactoring sprint:**
```
structural_search(min_complexity=15, node_type="method")  # find complexity hotspots
structural_search(min_params=5, visibility="public")      # candidates for parameter objects
```

---

## Export

Export the indexed function/method data to external systems for use outside of hammy.

### Redis

Requires the `redis` optional extra — see [Installation](#installation).

```bash
hammy export redis                          # defaults: localhost:6379, db 0, prefix "hammy"
hammy export redis --host redis.internal --db 2 --prefix myapp
hammy export redis --flush                  # delete existing keys before writing
```

Each function is stored as `{prefix}:func:{id}` → JSON blob containing name, file, line range, parameters, return type, summary, comments, and recent commit history.

Configure defaults in `hammy.yaml` to avoid repeating flags:

```yaml
export:
  redis:
    host: "redis.internal"
    port: 6379
    db: 2
    key_prefix: "myapp"
    batch_size: 200
    commit_depth: 10
    query_enabled: false  # set true to include Redis meta in MCP tool output
    # password: set here rather than via --password flag (avoids process listing exposure)
```

---

## Configuration

Each project keeps its own `hammy.yaml` in the project root. `hammy init` creates one for you. If neither exists, all defaults apply.

### Per-project isolation

**`project.name` is the key setting for multi-project setups.** Hammy uses it to derive a unique Qdrant collection prefix, so two projects on the same Qdrant instance never mix their indexes. Set it to something short and slug-friendly.

```
Project A: name: "storefront"   → collections: hammy_storefront_code_symbols, ...
Project B: name: "admin-panel"  → collections: hammy_admin_panel_code_symbols, ...
```

If you need manual control (e.g. sharing an index between environments), set `qdrant.collection_prefix` explicitly — that always takes precedence over the derived name.

### Full reference

```

### .hammyignore

Create a `.hammyignore` in your project root using standard gitignore syntax. It's merged with `.gitignore` and `.hgignore` — anything excluded by any of the three files is skipped during indexing.

```gitignore
# .hammyignore
.hammy/
vendor/
node_modules/
*.min.js
storage/framework/
bootstrap/cache/
obj/
bin/
```
